----what is docker?

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

----What is a Docker image?

A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.

----what is Heroku?

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

----what is continuous deployment and continuous integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are two important practices in software development that aim to improve the efficiency of software development and deployment.

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automatically building, testing, and validating changes to software code in a shared repository. By doing so, it allows developers to detect integration issues and bugs early in the development process. This practice encourages developers to test their code regularly and frequently, and it helps to improve the quality of the code in the repository.

Continuous Deployment (CD), on the other hand, is the practice of automatically deploying new changes to the codebase in a production environment. Once the code has been integrated and tested successfully, it is automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing. If the code passes the staging environment, it is then deployed to a production environment where end-users can use it.

In summary, CI and CD work hand-in-hand to ensure that software code is integrated, tested, and deployed quickly and efficiently. CI helps to ensure that all changes to the codebase are continuously tested and validated, while CD ensures that those changes are safely and efficiently deployed to end-users. Together, these two practices help to increase the speed and quality of software development while reducing the risk of errors and issues.
